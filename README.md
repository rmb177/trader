An amatuer attempt at creating a Bitcoin trading bot.

I pulled out the code I needed from https://github.com/irufus/gdax-java and pulled out all of the Spring framework code
as I don't know Spring and I just wanted straight java.

Threw in some rough testing, again, not using a framework just to get something done without having to incorporate a test
framework.

This should not be used to make you any money. If Bitcoin goes to 0 or decreases significantly over time, this bot
will not do well. It assumes that in general Bitcoin will continually rise and tries to earn some $ on the dips.
